# Anthropogenic_Activity_Detection
Detect man-made activities [walking, biking] along a fiber.

This repository provides a set of tools for **Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS)** and seismic data processing, focusing on three major tasks:

1. **Standard Deviation Downsampling** for DAS preprocessing.
2. **Radon Transform** and **Inverse Radon Transform** for velocity-domain filtering and event separation.
3. **Semblance Analysis** for velocity picking and coherence detection.

These tools are designed for large-scale datasets and can be easily extended for applications such as **human activity detection**, **event classification**.
